INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth Unsplash is a Unsplash authentication integration for Drupal. It
is based on the Social Auth and Social API projects.

It adds to the site:
 * A new url: /user/login/unsplash.
 * A settings form on /admin/config/social-api/social-auth/unsplash.
 * A Unsplash logo in the Social Auth Login block.
 
 REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the dependencies: Social API and Social Auth.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

 * A more comprehensive installation instruction for Drupal 8 can be found at
   https://www.drupal.org/node/2935878

CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your Amazon project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » Unsplash.

 * Place a Social Auth Unsplash block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

User can click on the Unsplash logo on the Social Auth Login block
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/unsplash, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

When the user opens the /user/login/unsplash link, it automatically takes
user to Unsplash for authentication. Unsplash then returns the user to
Drupal site. If we have an existing Drupal user with the same email address
provided by Unsplash, that user is logged in. Otherwise a new Drupal user is
created.
